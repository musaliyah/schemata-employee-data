  ## Description: 
  "Schemata, my Employee Data!" is an employee tracker, that aids in navigating various data relating to a company's employees. Employers can view their employees names, departments, salary totals and roles. Furthermore, they can add additional roles, departments and employees to the database. In working on this project, I developed my learning around Node.js and MySQL. I faced many challenges in organizing my functions in my server.js files, and ensuring that my various objects matched up with their table counterparts in my schema.sql and seed.sql files. In addition, I learned to navigated different errors related to Node.js. Often, I would get type-errors that would point to problems with my node-module files. However, the information these errors provided was often misleading, as the majority of the time they were resolved by fixing syntax and spelling errors in my server.js file. In addition, the program builds my learning on CLI -focused projects. I incorporated CFonts in order to incorporate more design to a program based in the terminal. 

  ## Installation: 
  To install "Schemata, my Employee Data!" Users must first clone my repo from GitHub, and have MySQL installed within their own device. Then, after installing MySQL and having my files on their own device, users can open an integrated terminal by right-clicking on the server.js file. After opening an integrated terminal, then user's must launch MySQL by typing "MySQL -u root -p" in the CLI and fill out their own password. Then, they must seed the SQL files. To seed the files, user's must type "source schema.sql" and "source seed.sql" in their terminal. After seeding the files, users can quit MySQL by typing "quit" and pressing enter. Lastly, to begin navigating the database, users must type "node server.js" into the terminal, and they should be presented with prompts.

  ## Usage: 
  To use the program, users can select amongst the various options, and type information that responds to the prompt. Importantly, when it comes to assigning new salary amounts, user's must only type out integers (no commas). To quit the program, select "quit" from the menu.
